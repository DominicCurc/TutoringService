        <br>I am from King of Prussia, a small town near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and I have a bachelor of science in computer science and a bachelor of arts in German from West Chester University. After graduation I moved to Omaha for my first job and I am still here, despite switching jobs, because I like it so much here.

        I am a remote software engineer for Aries Systems, a subsidiary of the academic publisher: Elsevier. Elsevier is the leading scientific and academic publisher in the world and it also makes apps to help said scientists. My team helped make and improve Editorial Manager, the main website where academics go to publish their papers.

        As part of my German major I tutored freshmen and sophomore students in German grammar and I read more than 10 novels in German and watched more than 15 movies. In addition to taking German classes at university, I also took Ancient Greek classes. I read the Apology of Socrates in the original and I learned dozens of fun ancient stories.

        Most American children do not remember their foreign language class from school well enough to go to said country without the crutch of English and while that is somewhat of a shame, the same can be said about most school subjects. Do you think that a Walmart cashier remembers what a mole from chemistry is? I do, however, find that most Americans leave their language study with an understanding of the other culture and fun memories thereof. And they understand grammar and semantics better than students who have avoided foreign language study.
