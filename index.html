    <h2>Why learn Ancient Greek:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Its grammatical complexity will make all other languages seem easy.</li>
        <li>The New Testament was originally written in Ancient Greek, so students would learn the origin of Christian words like "βιβλίον" (biblíon) where we get “Bible” and "χριστός" (christós) where we get "Christ" and it means “anointed as king”.
         <ul>
                <li>
                    Also the origin of many names, like Chloe and George
                </li>
            </ul></li>

        <li>30% of English words are derived from Ancient Greek.</li>
        <li>Children, and adults too, love hearing heroic stories and students would learn timeless stories that inspire wonder about the ancient world. Students of Latin, similarly, say that their favorite part about the class was the fun historical stories.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why learn German:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It’s a heritage language for a 42.7% of Nebraskans</li>
        <li>
            Nebraska is the state with the 3rd most German speakers behind only North and South Dakota
            <ul>
                <li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>German is the 2nd most spoken language in the EU. In case the person with whom you're speaking is not fluent enough in English</li>
    </ul>
